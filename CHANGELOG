* 0.9.4-DEV

If you have custom loaders, you MUST upgrade them for this release: The
Twig_Loader base class has been removed, and the Twig_LoaderInterface has also
been changed (see the source code for more information or the documentation).

 * made it possible to insert newlines in tag and variable blocks
 * fixed a bug when a literal '\n' were present in a template text
 * refactored loaders

* 0.9.3 (2009-11-11)

This release is NOT backward compatible with the previous releases.

  The loaders do not take the cache and autoReload arguments anymore. Instead,
  the Twig_Environment class has two new options: cache and auto_reload.
  Upgrading your code means changing this kind of code:

      $loader = new Twig_Loader_Filesystem('/path/to/templates', '/path/to/compilation_cache', true);
      $twig = new Twig_Environment($loader);

  to something like this:

      $loader = new Twig_Loader_Filesystem('/path/to/templates');
      $twig = new Twig_Environment($loader, array(
        'cache' => '/path/to/compilation_cache',
        'auto_reload' => true,
      ));

 * deprecated the "items" filter as it is not needed anymore
 * made cache and auto_reload options of Twig_Environment instead of arguments of Twig_Loader
 * optimized template loading speed
 * removed output when an error occurs in a template and render() is used
 * made major speed improvements for loops (up to 300% on even the smallest loops)
 * added properties as part of the sandbox mode
 * added public properties support (obj.item can now be the item property on the obj object)
 * extended set tag to support expression as value ({% set foo as 'foo' ~ 'bar' %} )
 * fixed bug when \ was used in HTML
