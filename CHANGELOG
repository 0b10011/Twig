* 0.9.4-DEV


* 0.9.3 (2009-11-11)

This release is NOT backward compatible with the previous releases.

  The loaders do not take the cache and autoReload arguments anymore. Instead,
  the Twig_Environment class has two new options: cache and auto_reload.
  Upgrading your code means changing this kind of code:

      $loader = new Twig_Loader_Filesystem('/path/to/templates', '/path/to/compilation_cache', true);
      $twig = new Twig_Environment($loader);

  to something like this:

      $loader = new Twig_Loader_Filesystem('/path/to/templates');
      $twig = new Twig_Environment($loader, array(
        'cache' => '/path/to/compilation_cache',
        'auto_reload' => true,
      ));

 * made cache and auto_reload options of Twig_Environment instead of arguments of Twig_Loader

 * removed output when an error occurs in a template and render() is used
 * made major speed improvements for loops (up to 300% on even the smallest loops)

 * fixed bug when \ was used in HTML
